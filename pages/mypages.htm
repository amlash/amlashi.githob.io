car himself which he refused. He was persistent so I had to take the car to the
police station, when I got there I talked to the duty officer and explained the
situation and asked him who reported it stolen and if he could show me the file
for this case, but he refused and told me to come and take the car from Traffic
Authority tomorrow. Next day I went with my wife to get the car back, after a
long wait, they released the car and I was still asking them who reported it
stolen but no one gave me any answer. The colleagues in my office and I had a
very good relationship before I went to Pakistan but after my arrival back, I
noticed most of them either ignore me or were not as friendly as before. I
understood things have now changed. My director then, sent me to the
intelligence office to report what had happened in Pakistan. In that letter I
have mentioned that I was not happy with what was going on in Pakistan,
exploiting the students and the poor people as their intelligence agents or
spy. I have also told them how could these people be trusted as they are not
even faithful to their own motherland then how can be faithful to us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
