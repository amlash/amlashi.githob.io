<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.5pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri'>myself
when one day they parked blocking our driveway. I approached them and politely
asked if I </span><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri'>could be of any
assistance. One Of Officers replied in a very plain and cold tone that they
were doing their job and it wasn't my business at all. I then retorted that it
certainly became my business when they were parked on my driveway. With the
police constantly driving around the periphery of my house, the neighbors had
started to cook up false ideas about me and my family. I went to the Eastwood
police station to discuss and ask if the police was suspicious about me or any
activities that I was involved in. I presented myself very calmly and requested
to speak to the senior official as</span><span style='font-family:"Courier New";
mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri'> </span><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:
Calibri'>the lower level officials did not seem to care </span><span
style='font-size:10.5pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri'>about what I was going
through. No one was there to listen to me and my experiences. Instead, I got
very cold and rude statements from them. I got helpless and overwhelmed with
frustration and agony and said &quot;If anyone appears near my house from now I
will destroy everyone and everything&quot;. Although my statement was just a
sentence that came out of a frustrated and helpless man banging his head for
peace and justice and trying to Shield his family from inhumane acts. I do not
regret the loud and firm words I used because what I noticed from the next
immediate day was that the watchdogs didn't appear close to my house. Not that
they had stopped their jobs, but now they stayed a bit further in the street.
Now the questions</span></p>
