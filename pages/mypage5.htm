After two months of working there I spoke with few Fijian co-workers during
lunch time. I told them my previous work experiences and how I got fired from
the jobs. They explained me that, the same was going to happen there too and I
would not be left alone anywhere. They also said that the people who were
behind me were sort of professionals. They would torture me to the extent that
I lost the balance of my mind. Then label me mentally sick, send me to the
mental hospital and medicate me. They were true in a sense. My shifts at MQF
started 5 Am in the morning. I had to leave home around 4.15 am in the</span><span

It would still be dark. I noticed one of my neighbors from 8-9 houses away
followed me in his car every morning from my house to the main street. And as I
said earlier, I ignored those activities and did not speak to anyone about it.
My Fijian co-workers suggested that I should build my own business and not rely
on other companies for jobs. That conversation was a real eye opener to me.
After a week I quitted the job and gradually started my own business. Our few
years stay at Kellyville was full of such incidents. A lady, who lived in the
house next to us, revealed that she was been forced to work for a group for
their interest and spy on </span><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri'>me
and report to them. She was a very honest lady and didn't want to get involved
