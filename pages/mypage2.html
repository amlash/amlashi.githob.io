block of apartments. One day when I came home around 4 pm, I saw few policemen
in the adjacent apartment, which was occupied by a young couple (Australian
looking). The lady who was very upset and distressed came out and told me that
their apartment got broken into. All of a sudden with no further communication
she shouted in agony &quot;Tell your friends to bring everything back &quot;I
was surprised and had no idea what she was talking. I thought she was in trauma
and ignored her comments then. Later on I came to know that there were three
Iranian young men renting the basement of the apartment and who within few
weeks of the burglary vacated the place. Not long after that we were told to
vacate the apartment by our owners too. We then moved to one of the ground
floor units in another block of apartments across the park about 500m away from
there. In the same apartment, just opposite to our unit, lived two young men
(in their mid-thirties). After few weeks I noticed an Indian looking lady
(25-30 years old), mother of 4-5 years old boy visited the Aussie men very
frequently. Her activities clearly revealed that she had an affair with one the
inmates. She used to monitor my homecoming time</span></p>
