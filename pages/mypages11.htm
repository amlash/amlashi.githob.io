police entering the fruit shop from a coffee shop outside (I was writing an
invoice). Then those gentlemen in blue shirts came close to me and stood around
for couple minutes, making me feel like a criminal. Following that incident,
the fruit shop refused to do any business with me. I have personally witnessed
both the situations. As mentioned earlier, I have been ignoring all these
activities for a long time, as I very well know the reason behind it. I have
spoken to many of my clients and explained that my reputation is being attacked

business relation. However, many of them simply do not wish to deal with me
because they do not like any trouble and wish to operate their business
smoothly. I do not blame them at all and I do wish that too. Everyone has a
