company and was immediately asked to leave. My innocent mind knew little that
the people, whom I directed to the manager, were policemen in ordinary clothes
and were there to talk about me. During those days, I put a business
partnership proposal to a young man (my son's friend). He clearly stated that
he did like the proposal but was scared that I was under surveillance and
having a business relation with me might endanger his own reputation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

then started my job hunt again. I got a job in a small plumbing pipes company
on Sunnyholt road Blacktown area. I hadn't worked there for long when a person
(in ordinary clothes) came and spoke to the manager clearly pointing to me.
Don't know if he was a police or a Civil, The next day, the manager called me
and fired me from the job. I was clueless and hopeless. I have no words to
explain the agony I was going through those days. I got repeatedly sacked from
one job after another despite my honest and loyal work ethics. I could neither
express this to my friends nor my family. I didn't have an answer to the
questions in their eyes. Thereafter, found myself a job at MQF, a sausage
manufacturing company in Flemington market</span></p>
