living in the same vicinity, who worked for a political party in the election
campaigns etc. who were convincing the lady to monitor our family. Later I came
to know that she got a call from a group of people to visit their office and
start working for them. She was scared to go there by herself and I had to take
someone with her. Frequently, group of men with bizarre appearances (could be <o:p></o:p></span></p>

got broken; my letters were opened and thrown in front of my house. Finally I
reported the incident to the local police. Constable Michelle Parragne wrote my
incident report then (I only reported the breaking in of my post box).While in
the area, I soon became aware of two houses (addresses no. l and no.4)
belonging to immigrants with Teenage children. These young people were coerced
into working in surveillance (as a 'watchdog') for the government .Something I
have not seen happening in any other country.</span></p>
