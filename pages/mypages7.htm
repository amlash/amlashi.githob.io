have been surprised to see that misleading and damaging information about me
had gone to the databases of various government and private businesses like
commonwealth bank, ANZ etc. Limiting opportunities at work was evident
everywhere and everyone I worked for. During 1999, I worked to sell products
for commissions for a company named Sidam. A lady and a man came there too and
spoke to the manager. Few days later I was told that if I didn't meet certain
target sales, I could go. I can confidently say that the lady that came there
was the same who used to observe me when I lived in Epping. I saw the extent of
this action in the year 2000 when a girl of approximately 15 years was made to
follow and observe my actions with a male companion. This girl was acting under
the Iranian government and the Australian government, and has been abused and
let down by the systems. Today, this girl has a young daughter of her own, and
I wonder what her damaged mother is going to teach her. Our life at Cheltenham
was even harsher. What added to the severity of the situation was, the police,
entrusted with power to protect the rights and dignity of the residents, seemed

style='font-size:10.5pt;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri'>ith the perpetrators.
Very often police cars hovered around our house. Many times parked nearby and
stayed for a quite a long time. However, I could not resist</span></p>
